Grafana k6 is an open-source load testing tool that makes performance testing easy and productive for engineering teams. k6 is free, developer-centric, and extensible.

Key features:
- CLI Tool: with developer friendly APIs
- Scripting in JavaScript ES2015/ES6 : with support for local and remote modules
- Checks and Threshold - For goal-oriented, automation-friendly load testing.

Use Cases:
- Load Testing: is optimized for minimal resource consumption and designed for running high load tests ( spike, stress, soak tests)
- Browser Testing: you can run browser-based performance testing and catch issues related to browser only which can be skipped entirely from the protocol level.
- Chaos and resilience testing: We can simulate traffic as part of chaos experiments, trigger them from your k6 tests or inject different types of faults in kubernetes with xk6-disruptor.
- Performance and synthetic monitoring: You can automate and schedule to trigger tests very frequently with a small load to continuously validate the performance and availability of your production environment.
