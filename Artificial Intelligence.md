Machine learning can be broadly categorized into four main types, each with distinct approaches to learning from data:

1. **Supervised Learning:** In this type, the training data is labeled. This means each data point has a corresponding output or target value. The machine learning algorithm learns by analyzing the relationship between the inputs and their desired outputs. Common applications include classification (e.g., spam filtering) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).

	2. Logistic Regression
	3. Decision Tree
	4. Random Forest
	5. Naive Bayes Classifier
	6. K-Nearest Neighbour
	7. Support Vector Machines

    
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm's goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data itself. This can involve tasks like grouping similar data points together (clustering) or dimensionality reduction (compressing complex data).
    
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** This method is inspired by how humans learn through trial and error. The algorithm interacts with an environment and receives rewards or penalties for its actions. Over time, it learns to take actions that maximize its rewards. This is commonly used in training AI agents for games or robotics.
    
4. **Semi-Supervised Learning:** This approach combines labeled and unlabeled data for training. It leverages the power of labeled data to guide the learning process while also utilizing the vast amount of unlabeled data that might be available. This is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain
