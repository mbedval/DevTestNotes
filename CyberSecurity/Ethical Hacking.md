#### Defence in Depth

Defense in depth is a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls to protect an organization's assets. The key principles are:

- Layered security: Implementing a variety of security measures at different levels (physical, technical, administrative) to create redundancy. If one layer is breached, other layers can still stop the attack.
	- Various Layered Security 
		- Perimeter Security
		- Network Security
		- End Point Security
		- Application Security
		- Users (Identity Security)
		- Data Security 
- Preventing and detecting threats: Using a combination of preventative controls (e.g. firewalls, antivirus) and detection mechanisms (e.g. intrusion detection, behavioral analysis) to stop attacks before they succeed and identify ongoing threats. lateral movement by attackers who have gained initial access.
- Adapting to evolving threats: Continuously updating security measures to address new vulnerabilities and attack vectors, especially as organizations move more infrastructure to the cloud.

The goal of defense in depth is to make it as difficult as possible for attackers to successfully compromise an organization's systems and data. By having multiple layers of security, the likelihood of a breach is minimized, and the impact can be contained if one layer is breached.[](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/defense-in-depth)

#### STAGES of Hacking

| --- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Reconnaissance        | Gather data and information of target (either Actively or passively)                                                                                                       |
| 2   | Weaponization         | Based on target identify right tool and technique to attack                                                                                                                |
| 3   | Delivery              | Perform the logistic activity to deliver the bundled program to target network and system.                                                                                 |
| 4   | Exploitation          | Exploit or take advantage of the vulnerability (weakness) in/on the target                                                                                                 |
| 5   | Installation          | Over Exploitation, install malware to the target system, and install other required packages/ software to support the objective of Hacking                                 |
| 6   | Command and Control   | Establish "Connection Back" for future exploitation, where attacker monitor and interact with target machine with unauthorized background access.                          |
| 7   | Actions on Objectives | Perform the action for which all hacking process was started. malicious actions like Espionage, Data exfiltration, using infrastructure of scaling attack on bigger target |
