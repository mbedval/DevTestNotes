Data-driven testing is a software testing methodology where test data is stored in external data sources, such as spreadsheets, CSV files, or databases

This approach allows testers to create and run tests for multiple data sets using a single test script, making it more efficient and easier to maintain compared to creating individual tests for each data set

### Key Features of Data-Driven Testing

#####  **Separation of Test Data and Test Scripts**:    
- Test data is stored in external files, such as Excel, CSV, or databases, and is read by the test scripts.
- This separation keeps the test data and test scripts independent, making it easier to manage and maintain both    
##### **Flexibility and Reusability**:    
- The same test script can be used with different data sets, increasing test coverage and reducing the need to create multiple test scripts.
- Test cases can be easily modified by adding or changing data in the external files, without affecting the test scripts themselves
##### **Time-Saving**:    
- Automates the testing process by eliminating the need to manually execute tests for each data set.
- Allows for the execution of large volumes of test data, which is useful for regression testing and ensuring that the application functions correctly with various inputs    
##### **Improved Test Coverage**:    
- Enables the execution of both positive and negative test cases, ensuring that the application handles both valid and invalid inputs correctly.
- Helps in identifying bugs and ensuring that the application is robust and stable

### Types of Data-Driven Testing

1. **Keyword-Driven Testing**:
    
    - Uses keywords in test scripts and a data table to list inputs and expected outcomes for each keyword.
    - Allows for free changes in test cases without affecting the scripts[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-driven-testing/).
    
2. **Excel-Driven Testing**:
    
    - Uses Excel spreadsheets to specify and arrange test data.
    - Test scripts can run tests with various sets of data and are easy to maintain because they read data from Excel files[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-driven-testing/).
    
3. **XML Testing**:
    
    - Uses XML files to describe test data.
    - Works well with complex data structures and is useful for testing applications that handle structured data


### Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and effort by automating the testing process.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for easy modification of test data without changing the test scripts.
- **Reusability**: Reusable test cases and functions reduce the need to create new scripts.
- **Improved Test Coverage**: Increases the number of test cases that can be executed, ensuring a more comprehensive test suite

### Disadvantages
- **Dependency on Automation Skills**: The quality of the test depends on the automation team's skills.
- **Complexity**: Requires high-level technical skills and can be complex to implement.
- **Maintenance**: Requires more documentation and can be challenging to maintain due to the complexity of the test scripts
