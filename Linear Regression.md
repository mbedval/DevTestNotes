	Linear Regression is method to predict dependent variable (Y) based on values of independent variable (X). It can be used for the cases where we want to predict some continuous quantity.
Dependent Variable (Y) is the response variable who's value needs to be predicted.
Independent Variable (X): The predictor variable used to predict the response variable.

$$
Y = Bo + B1X +E
